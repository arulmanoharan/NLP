NLP Assignment 1

The Content and Ask of Assignment 1:

Part I
Sentence comparison using N-gram:
Let a search engine powered by language model recommend which of the below
sentences are most relevant w.r.t to given training corpus. Design a probabilistic language
model to compare below test sentences for recommendation using bigram. Use all the instances
in the dataset as a training corpus.
Test Sentence 1: “Petter Mattei's 'Love in the Time of Money' is a visually stunning film to
watch.”
Test Sentence 2: “I sure would like to see a resurrection of an updated Seahunt series with the
tech they have today”
Part II
Perform the below sequential tasks on the given dataset.
i) Text Preprocessing:
a. Tokenization
b. Lowercasing
c. Stop Words Removal
d. Stemming
e. Lemmatization
ii) Feature Extraction:
Use the pre-processed data from previous step and implement the below vectorization
methods to extract features.
Word Embedding using TD-IDF
iii) Similarity Analysis:
Use the vectorized representation from previous step and implement a method to
identify and print the names of top two similar words that exhibit significant similarity. Justify
your choice of similarity metric and feature design. Visualize a subset of vector embedding in
2D semantic space suitable for this use case. HINT: (Use PCA for Dimensionality reduction)
